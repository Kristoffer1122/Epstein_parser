### Epstein file parser.

# Look for names in Epstein files.

# Used by VG.NO
I made this during my time in praksis at VG.NO, to parse through the Epstein files that were released in feb 2026.
The files are in PDF format, and this script extracts names from them.
Usable as a C program or a Python script, the Python script runs through Dataset 10 (540,000 PDFs) in about 5 min on a 192 core machine ;p


# how to run:
´make run´
